<h2> C language / C ++ development environment construction on Ubuntu </ h2>

It is a procedure to build a C language / C ++ development environment on Ubuntu.

<h3> Make Ubuntu available </ h3>

Let's make Ubuntu available.

<ul>
  <li> <a href="/blog/20200509155552.html"> How to use Ubuntu </a> </ li>
</ ul>

Proceed to the console screen where you can execute commands, and then log in as the initial user.

The individual procedures using VPS and cloud server are published below.

</ ul>

<h3> Create User </ h3>

Next, create a user on the console screen. Let's create two users, one to run the web application (myapp) and one to our own (for example, kimoto).

Add user There is an "-m" option, set a password, and add it to the <a href="/blog/20200406174004.html"> sudo </a> group.

<ul>
  <li> <a href="/blog/20200511173052.html"> Add user --useradd command </a> </ li>
</ ul>

<h3> Firewall settings </ h3>

Open the following ports in the firewall settings of the network provided by the hosting service. If you are building your server on-premises, use the <a href="/blog/20200907132441.html"> ufw command </a> to open the following ports.

<table>
  <tr> <td> SSH </ td> <td> <a href="/blog/20200715102902.html"> SSH port </a> (default port 22 is dangerous) </ td>
</ table>

<h3> Using SSH client </ h3>

Let's connect to the server with SSH from the computer so that you can execute commands and edit files.

<h4> Command execution on SSH client </ h4>

In the case of Windows, TeraTerm is a tool for connecting to an SSH server with an SSH client and executing commands.

</ ul>

There are SSH clients that work on other Windows such as <a href="https://www.atmarkit.co.jp/ait/articles/1006/25/news095.html"> PuTTY </a>, so you can use it as you like. so.

For Mac, you can use the ssh command from the terminal.

<h4> Use SCP to edit files on the server </ h4>

You can edit files on the server using a protocol built on SSH called SCP.

WinSCP is the SCP client for Windows.

</ ul>

There is software on your Mac that can replace WinSCP on Windows, so install it.

<h3> SSH server settings </ h3>

  <li> <a href="/blog/20200715102902.html"> Change SSH port-default port 22 is a high security risk </a> </ li>
</ ul>

<h3> Time zone setting </ h3>

Let's set the time zone to "Asia / Tokyo".

<ul>
  <li> <a href="/blog/20200507174004.html"> Checking and setting the time zone --timedatectl command </a> </ li>
</ ul>

<h3> Package installation </ h3>

Ubuntu's package management tool is apt. Install the package may not work, so make sure you have the latest version of apt first.

<ul>
  <li> <a href="/blog/20200524135533.html"> apt update --apt update </a> </ li>
</ ul>

First, let's build a web server, application server, mail sending server, and DB server all in one machine.

<h4> Compiler Linker </ h4>

Install gcc for C language compilation, g ++ for C ++ compilation, and make, a tool that can resolve compilation dependencies.

<ul>
  <li> <a href="/blog/20200514084132.html"> Install make </a> </ li>
  <li> <a href="/blog/20200504174004.html"> Install gcc </a> </ li>
  <li> <a href="/blog/20200503174004.html"> Install g ++ </a> </ li>
</ ul>

<h4> Repository management </ h4>

Install <a href="https://en.git.perlzemi.com/>Git </a> so that you can manage the C / C ++ source code.

<ul>
  <li> <a href="/blog/20200607082859.html"> Install git-Git distributed repository management system </a> </ li>
</ ul>

good job for today.
