<h2> Settings that allow Apache to execute CGI with document rooting </ h2>

It is a description of the setting that enables CGI to be executed by document rooting in Apache of Ubuntu.

Even if you do <a href="/blog/20200316174004.html"> enable mod_cgid </a> to use CGI in Apache settings of Ubuntu, "/ usr / lib / cgi-bin /" You can only run CGI with:

<h4> Apache config file for running CGI under the document root </ h3>

Apache's configuration file for running CGI under the document root. It is supposed to operate in <a href="/blog/20200314174004.html"> default virtual host </a>.

<VirtualHost *: 80>
  ServerName www.mydomain.example

  DocumentRoot "/ var / www / html"

  AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

  <Directory / var / www / html>
    Options + ExecCGI
  </ Directory>
</ VirtualHost>
