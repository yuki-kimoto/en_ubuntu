<h2> Install make </h2>

I will explain how to install make. Install make using the <a href="/blog/20200530085516.html"> apt</a> command. Run with administrator privileges using sudo.

<pre>
sudo apt install -y make
</pre>

<h3> Main uses of make </h3>

make is a tool mainly used to check source file dependencies and compile only source files that need to be recompiled when compiling C source files.

You can also create a make subcommand (not really a subcommand) such as "make test" or "make install" to execute a series of shell commands or programs.

make is also required when installing Perl modules from <a href="https://perlzemi.com/blog/20100504127089.html"> CPAN</a>. For <a href="https://perlzemi.com/blog/20100809127859.html"> XS module</a> that contains C source code, of course it is necessary, but it includes C source code. Modules that aren't there are often needed.

In most cases, <a href="https://perlzemi.com/blog/20170210150108.html"> ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a> is used. Not needed if Module::Build or Module::Build::Tiny is used.

You can compile the module, place the files in a directory, test it, and install it by simply following these steps:

<pre>
make
make test
make install
</pre>

This is done in the CPAN module installation.
