<h2> Installing the ssh package-SSH server and client </h2>

To enable SSH server and SSL client, install the ssh package using the <a href="/blog/20200530085516.html"> apt</a> command.

<pre>
# SSH server and SSH client installation
sudo apt install -y ssh
</pre>

This is an open source project that includes an SSH client and SSH server called OpenSSH.

Install the SSH server and client if they are not installed by default.

You can also install the SSH server and SSH client separately.

<pre>
# SSH client
sudo apt install -y ssh openssh-client

# SSH server
sudo apt install -y ssh openssh-server
</pre>

<h4> Confirm that the ssh command has been installed </h4>

Make sure you have the ssh command installed.

<pre>
ssh --help
</pre>

<h4> Confirm that the ssh server is installed </h4>

Confirm that the ssh server is installed with the <a href="/blog/20200605104005.html"> systemctl</a> command. Execute with administrator privileges with <a href="/blog/20200531085516.html"> sudo</a>.

<pre>
sudo systemctl status ssh
</pre>

If it says active, the installation is successful and the SSH server is up.
