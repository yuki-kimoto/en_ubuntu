<h2> Install wkhtmltopdf-convert HTML to PDF </h2>

I will explain how to install wkhtmltopdf. Install wkhtmltopdf using the <a href="/blog/20200530085516.html"> apt</a> command. Run with administrator privileges using sudo.

<pre>
sudo apt install -y wkhtmltopdf
</pre>

<h3> Confirmation of installation of wkhtmltopdf </h3>

Make sure the wkhtmltopdf command is available.

<pre>
wkhtmltopdf
</pre>

<h3> What is wkhtmltopdf? </H3>

wkhtmltopdf is a tool for converting HTML to PDF. Converts the result rendered by the rendering engine Webkit to PDF.

wkhtmltopdf can be used to create PDF forms. It is convenient to convert a form made of HTML that is published for free on the Web to PDF.

The generated PDF does not reach the quality of the book, but I think it can be used for the production of vocational school textbooks and doujinshi.

<h3> Fixed a bug that wkhtmltopdf cannot be executed </h3>

It seems that X Server or Qt is required for PDF generation of wkhtmltopdf, but there is a bug that can not be executed if the old Qt is not patched.

<a href="https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/2037"> QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display</a>

One way to solve this seems to be to install wkhtmltopdf, which utilizes patched Qt. This may not be a formal means.

<pre>
cd ~
wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases/download/0.12.3/wkhtmltox-0.12.3_linux-generic-amd64.tar.xz
tar vxf wkhtmltox-0.12.3_linux-generic-amd64.tar.xz

mkdir -p / usr / local / bin
sudo cp wkhtmltox / bin / wk * / usr / local / bin /
</pre>

<pre>
$/ usr / local / bin / wkhtmltopdf --version
</pre>

<pre>
wkhtmltopdf 0.12.3 (with patched qt)
</pre>

<h3> Solution when wkhtmltopdf shows SSL error Check on Ubuntu 18 </h3>

To solve this, the procedure to install the latest version of wkhtmltopdf on Ubuntu 18 is published, so I will write it here.

<h4> Install wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6 on Ubuntu 18. </h4>

Installing 0.12.6 on Ubuntu 18.

Then I upgraded to 0.12.6 and fixed the issues found in 0.12.4 and 0.12.5.

The updated installation procedure is as follows:

Check the version you are currently using, if any.

<pre>
$wkhtmltopdf --version
</pre>

<pre>
wkhtmltopdf 0.12.3 (with patched qt)
</pre>

Delete the existing version by finding and deleting all the files in "wkhtml".

<pre>
sudo find / -name * wkhtml *
</pre>

Delete "wkhtmltopdf" and "wkhtmltox" related files.

Download the version 0.12.6 .deb package.

<pre>
wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-1/wkhtmltox_0.12.6-1.bionic_amd64.deb
</pre>

Install the .deb package.

<pre>
sudo dpkg -i wkhtmltox_0.12.6-1.bionic_amd64.deb
</pre>


If you get the error that the dependency is missing, use "sudo apt install -f" to install the dependency.

Make sure the correct version is installed and accessible.

<pre>
$wkhtmltopdf --version
</pre>

<pre>
wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6 (with patched qt)
</pre>
