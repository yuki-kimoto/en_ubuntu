<h2> Check the physically attached disk --fdisk -l </h2>

Use "fdisk -l" to see which disks are physically attached to Ubuntu. It is assumed that an external hard disk is connected or a hard disk is added (attached) from the GUI screen using a cloud service. This state is not yet recognized by the Linux file system, and a device called a hard disk is physically connected.

First, use "fdisk -l" to check the status of the connected disk. Run with administrator privileges using <a href="/blog/20200531085516.html"> sudo</a>.

<pre>
sudo fdisk -l
</pre>

This is a sample output result. This sample is a 1TiB disk connected.

"/ Dev / sda: 30 GiB" is the first disc that existed. "/ Dev / sdb" seems to be the area used to start booting (probably). Booting is the booting of the OS.

A 1TiB disk is connected to "/ dev / sdc".

In <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/"> Linux</a>, names like "/ dev / sda" "/ dev / sdb" "/ dev / sdc" are physical. The disk is represented.

Disk and Device are a set. If there is no item called Device, it means that the partition has not been created yet.

"/ Dev / sda" is even more

It is divided into areas with numbers at the end. This is a logical disk partition using a feature called partitioning.

"/ Dev / sda" represents a physical disk, and the divided "/ dev / sda1", "/ dev / sda14", and "/ dev / sda15" represent a logical disk.
